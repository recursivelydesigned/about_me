		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>I was born in Brooklyn, NY. I've lived in Brooklyn my whole life with the exception of college, where I went to Rice University in Houston, TX. While in college, I majored in Math and Physics, thinking that I would like to work in a physics labratory. After my Junior year though, I realized that I actually preferred the math aspects of physics to the lab aspects of physics and found working in a lab to be an isolating experience. Because of these two things I decided to become a math teacher. I became a math teacher at age 23 and have worked at the same school for the last 8 years. In the last three years I have been teaching myself computer science and I'm excited to now be teaching computer science at the school for the last two years.</p>
		<p>Outside of work I enjoy traveling, hiking, camping, rock climbing, and hanging out with my dog Skye. I also enjoy learning new things, mainly math/programming stuff!</p>

		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>Every day I use my computer and phone. I spend way too much time on the internet - refreshing email, news, reddit over and over. I use my computer for work - writing lessons and programming every day too. I've been doing a bunch of programming in a variety of languages, mainly Python and Web Design stuff using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I spend a lot of time on youtube watching video tutorials to learn more about programming and backpacking. On my phone, my most used apps are probably messenger and Instagram. I also like listening to podcast while driving - my favorite podcasts are programming podcasts like Syntax or Talk Python To Me.</p>
